# Aoc2021

Reposity for my [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com)

Generally modules will be named `Day<n>`, sample and "real" data files kept under `priv`

Developed and tested on the following elixir/erlang versions:

```
Erlang/OTP 24 [erts-12.1.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [ds:4:4:10] [async-threads:1] [jit] [dtrace]

Elixir 1.12.3 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 24)
```

Run the testsuite with `mix test`
